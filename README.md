# heic2jpeg

Simple application to convert a HEIC-image to JPEG based on an example from adrium/goheif. It was wrapped with CLI-parameter.
Actually this is the frist step. :)

__Usage:__
```
heic2jpeg <filename.heic>
```

It reads the HEIC-file and converts the file to a JPEG. Naming of the file is the same like the HEIC-file, but .jpg, instead of .HEIC.
